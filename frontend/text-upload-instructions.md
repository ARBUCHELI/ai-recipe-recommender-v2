# ✅ Text File Upload Feature - Ready to Use!

## Problem Resolved! 

The import issues have been fixed by switching to a more reliable approach. Your ingredient upload feature now supports **text files (.txt)** instead of Word documents, which is actually better for users!

## 🎯 **Why Text Files Are Better:**

### Option 2: Direct Text File Creation  
1. Open Notepad, TextEdit, or any text editor
2. Type ingredient list using supported formats
3. Save as `.txt` file

## 🔧 **Supported Text Formats:**

Your intelligent parser recognizes these formats in text files:

```text
