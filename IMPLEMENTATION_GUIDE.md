# AI Recipe Recommender - User-Specific Data Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of user-specific data storage to fix the issue where recipes and ingredients persist across different user sessions.

## Problem Statement
- Recipes and ingredients were stored in localStorage and CSV/JSON files
- Data persisted across logout/login sessions
- Data was not user-specific, causing privacy and data leakage issues

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Recipe Service (`backend/src/services/recipeService.ts`)
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for user-specific recipes
- ✅ User authentication checks for all operations  
- ✅ Recipe filtering, searching, and pagination
- ✅ Public/private recipe management
- ✅ User recipe statistics

#### 2. Ingredient Service (`backend/src/services/ingredientService.ts`)
- ✅ Global ingredient management
- ✅ Ingredient suggestions and search
- ✅ Category management
- ✅ Ingredient seeding functionality

#### 3. Updated Routes
- ✅ Recipe routes (`backend/src/routes/recipes.ts`) - Full implementation
- ✅ Ingredient routes (`backend/src/routes/ingredients.ts`) - New routes added
- ✅ Routes integrated into main app (`backend/src/index.ts`)

#### 4. Database Optimization
- ✅ Migration script for seeding ingredients
- ✅ Performance indexes for recipes and ingredients
- ✅ Foreign key constraint verification

### Frontend Changes ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Service Layer
- ✅ Recipe Service (`frontend/src/services/recipeService.ts`) - API communication
- ✅ Ingredient Service (`frontend/src/services/ingredientService.ts`) - API communication
- ✅ Updated AI Service (`frontend/src/services/aiService.ts`) - Backend integration

#### 2. User-Aware Storage
- ✅ Updated LocalStorage Service (`frontend/src/utils/localStorage.ts`)
  - User-specific keys for all stored data
  - Automatic cleanup on logout
  - Prevention of data leakage between users

#### 3. Authentication Integration
- ✅ Updated AuthContext (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
  - Service token management
  - User context setting for all services
  - Proper cleanup on logout

### Frontend Components - REMAINING WORK ⚠️

The following components need to be updated to use the new backend services:

#### Components to Update:
1. **Recipe Display Components**
   - `RecipeCard.tsx` - Already uses proper Recipe interface
   - `RecipeGrid.tsx` or similar - Need to use `recipeService.getUserRecipes()`
   - Recipe detail views - Use `recipeService.getRecipeById()`

2. **Recipe Management Components**
   - Recipe creation forms - Use `recipeService.createRecipe()`
   - Recipe editing forms - Use `recipeService.updateRecipe()`
   - Recipe deletion - Use `recipeService.deleteRecipe()`

3. **Ingredient Components**
   - Ingredient selection/input components - Use `ingredientService.getAutocompleteIngredients()`
   - Category filters - Use `ingredientService.getIngredientCategories()`
   - Ingredient upload - Replace CSV/JSON with backend services

4. **AI Recipe Generation**
   - Update generation components to use `AIService.generateRecipe(ingredients, true)` for auto-save
   - Update meal plan generation with auto-save enabled

#### Example Component Update Pattern:

**Before (using localStorage):**
```tsx
const [recipes, setRecipes] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  const storedRecipes = LocalStorageService.getUserMemory().history.recipes;
  setRecipes(storedRecipes);
}, []);
```

**After (using backend service):**
```tsx
const [recipes, setRecipes] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchRecipes = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    const result = await recipeService.getUserRecipes();
    if (result.success) {
      setRecipes(result.recipes || []);
    }
    setLoading(false);
  };
  
  fetchRecipes();
}, []);
```

## Database Migration Steps

1. **Run the ingredient seeding:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Direct SQL execution
   psql -d your_database -f backend/prisma/migrations/migration_seed_ingredients.sql
   
   # Option 2: Use the backend endpoint
   POST /api/ingredients/seed
   ```

2. **Verify database setup:**
   - Check that ingredients table has data
   - Verify all indexes are created
   - Test foreign key constraints

## Testing Checklist

### Backend API Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] User authentication works
- [x] Recipe CRUD operations are user-scoped
- [x] Ingredient suggestions work
- [x] Database relations are properly enforced

### Frontend Integration Testing (TODO)
- [ ] Login/logout properly sets up user context
- [ ] Recipes are user-specific
- [ ] Data doesn't persist across different user sessions
- [ ] Ingredients load from backend instead of static files
- [ ] AI-generated recipes are saved to user's account
- [ ] Recipe search and filtering work
- [ ] Public recipe discovery works

### User Experience Testing (TODO)
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's recipes
- [ ] Logout completely cleans up User A's data
- [ ] Login as User B shows only User B's data
- [ ] Recipe generation and saving works seamlessly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for recipe/ingredient operations

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration:** Run the SQL migration before deploying frontend changes
2. **Environment Variables:** Ensure `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is correctly set
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Users may lose locally stored recipes during the transition
4. **Data Migration:** Consider creating a tool to migrate existing localStorage data to user accounts

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

1. **Update Frontend Components** (Primary remaining task)
   - Identify all components that use localStorage for recipes/ingredients
   - Replace with appropriate service calls
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Test user-specific data isolation

2. **Enhanced Features** (Future enhancements)
   - Recipe sharing between users
   - Recipe ratings and reviews
   - Advanced search with full-text search
   - Recipe collections and favorites
   - Import/export functionality

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add pagination to recipe lists
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add search debouncing

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend Files:
- ✅ `src/services/recipeService.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/services/ingredientService.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/routes/recipes.ts` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `src/routes/ingredients.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/index.ts` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `prisma/migrations/migration_seed_ingredients.sql` (NEW)

### Frontend Files:
- ✅ `src/services/recipeService.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/services/ingredientService.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/services/aiService.ts` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `src/utils/localStorage.ts` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (UPDATED)

### Components to Update:
- ⚠️ Various component files that currently use localStorage or static files
- ⚠️ Recipe display and management components
- ⚠️ Ingredient input and selection components
- ⚠️ AI generation result components

## Summary

The core infrastructure for user-specific data storage has been implemented:
- ✅ Backend services and API endpoints
- ✅ Frontend service layer
- ✅ User-aware storage management
- ✅ Authentication integration
- ✅ Database optimizations

**Remaining work:** Update frontend components to use the new backend services instead of localStorage and static files.

This implementation ensures that:
1. **Data Privacy:** Each user only sees their own recipes and data
2. **Data Persistence:** Recipes are saved in the database, not localStorage
3. **Multi-user Support:** Multiple users can use the app without data conflicts
4. **Professional Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns with backend APIs

Once the frontend components are updated, the application will be fully professional with proper user data isolation.
